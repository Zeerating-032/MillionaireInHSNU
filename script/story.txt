A:Hi.
A:I would like to tell you a story.
:Okay. He isn't a bad guy, I thinks.
A:Once upon a time, there's a poor person living with his young daughter.
A:The man needed some money to go to the capital to take a exam, once he got good grade, he would be able to escape from such a bad life.
:Sounds great. But the exam is not easy, right?
A:Yes. The exam was only hold once for three years. Those who want to become a government official must seize this opportunity.
A:So, he sold his daughter to a rich widow, from who he had borrow money, as maid and her son's wife in the future.

:Oh no! What happen after that?
A:Want to know what happened, come here tomorrow. Bye bye!
